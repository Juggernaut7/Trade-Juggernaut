# Vercel Deployment Fix

## What was the problem?
Your React app with React Router wasn't working properly on Vercel because:
- Vercel's server didn't know about your client-side routes (`/dashboard`, `/crypto/:id`)
- When users visited these routes directly, Vercel tried to find files at those paths
- Since these are React routes (not actual files), it resulted in 404 errors

## What I fixed:

### 1. Created `vercel.json`
This file tells Vercel to:
- Redirect all requests to `index.html` (where your React app lives)
- Let React Router handle the routing on the client side
- Add proper caching headers for assets
- Include security headers

### 2. Updated `vite.config.js`
Added proper build configuration for deployment compatibility.

## Next Steps:

1. **Commit and push these changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel routing configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Your project should automatically redeploy with the new configuration
   - Or manually trigger a new deployment

3. **Test your routes:**
   - Visit your landing page (should work as before)
   - Try visiting `/dashboard` directly in a new tab
   - Try visiting `/crypto/bitcoin` directly
   - All should now work properly!

## How it works:
The `vercel.json` rewrite rule `"source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html"` tells Vercel to serve your `index.html` file for any route, allowing React Router to take over and handle the routing on the client side.

This is the standard solution for Single Page Applications (SPAs) deployed on Vercel.
